## Weather Forecast Data Dashboard

### Overview
This project is a cloud-hosted weather forecasting dashboard that integrates real-time weather data, processes it efficiently, and visualizes trends using interactive graphs. Built with **Python**, **Django**, and **Plotly**, the application fetches and analyzes live weather data to provide users with actionable insights.

### Features
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Fetches live weather data from OpenWeather API.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations:** Uses Plotly to display temperature trends, humidity levels, and precipitation forecasts.
- **Cloud-Based Hosting:** Deployed using **AWS Lambda** and **S3**, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency.

### Tech Stack
- **Python** for data fetching, processing, and analysis.
- **Django** for backend logic and API integration.
- **Plotly** for interactive data visualizations.
- **AWS Lambda & S3** for scalable, serverless deployment.

### Installation & Usage
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecast-dashboard.git
cd weather-forecast-dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```

### Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional data sources for more precise forecasts.
- Expand visualization capabilities with more advanced analytics.
- Implement predictive modeling using machine learning.
